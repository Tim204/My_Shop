# Project MyShop

## Description
MyShop is an ecommerce application designed in order to mimic a somewhat realistic real life online shoping experience.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.9
* Django 4.0

### Installing
To install dependencies run the following command inside your virtual environment:

```bash
    pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

## Issues
The hero-slider(carousel) on the index page might feel heavy on certain devices. Still trying to figure out the root cause of the issue.
Decreasing the number of images on the slide seems to lessen the problem

**_NOTE:_**  In order to use the credit card payment system you are required to create a Braintree Sandbox account and have internet connection whenever you try to perform a payment or else an exception will be raised.
